As an Artificial Intelligence expert, you can join “social media” communities for data mining and text analytics professionals to ”network”, share knowledge and resources
And get ideas for Text Analytics applied research projects … 
General social media have AI groups/networks, eg:
FaceBook, LinkedIn, Quora
Other communities set up by/for academics and practitioners to share knowledge, ask questions, find resources, …
KDnuggets, Kaggle, Weka, ICAME, ACL, SemEval, 
EU-JRC communities, etc, etc…
Data mining and text analytics online communities and resources	

Facebook https://facebook.com

Quora https://www.quora.com/ 
“Quora is a social question-and-answer website” 
“Quora is a place to gain and share knowledge. It's a platform to ask questions and connect with people who contribute unique insights and quality answers.”
?better than Google search for specific technical AI questions, eg “How can I avoid overfitting?”


KDnuggets: Knowledge Discovery nuggets 
https://kdnuggets.com  

knowledge discovery: “extracting useful knowledge from data” (aka data mining  / machine learning)
“A knowledge nugget is a small item or piece of useful knowledge in categories of interest to the user. It's "business trainers' jargon", not a general purpose idiom” (https://english.stackexchange.com/) 
News, tutorials, reviews, jobs, …
Originally academic, now mainly AI industry practitioners
 

Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/  
competitions, data-sets, discussion… taken over by Google
Competitors can use Kaggle/Google cloud resources
Past contests are archived, with access to data, discussions…
Originally “enthusiasts”, now with Industry sponsors, prizes, large data-sets useful for “real” applications
“Kaggle offers a no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment. Access free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data & code.”

WEKA Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis
 https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/
Website for University of Waikato ML research group, 
Has grown into a hub for Weka users: downloads, textbook, tutorials, contribution add-ons, …
More open, community-based than commercial AI product websites

ICAME: International Computer Archive of Modern English http://icame.uib.no/
First English text corpora: Brown, LOB, ICE etc 
ICAME conference every year (43rd in 2022)

CORPORA mailing list and email discussion forum 
http://icame.uib.no/corpora/ 

ACL: Association for Computational Linguistics https://aclweb.org 
“Professional body” for CL/NLP/TA
Computational Linguistics journal, conferences, resources
 journals https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/Journals 
conferences https://www.aclweb.org/portal/events 
Research papers: ACL Anthology https://aclanthology.org/ 
Many SIGs Special Interest Groups, eg SIGWAC SIGSEM

SemEval: Semantic Evaluation workshops https://semeval.github.io
Academic conference papers, plus “shared tasks” +data-sets, competitors write paper on methods and results,
Kaggle-like contests, with academic research papers to cite
For your own application: find a related SemEval task, see a range of approaches (and scores) to try on your own task
Some SemEval big data-sets are archived for re-use, eg 
Offensive Language Identification Dataset - OLID

EU-JRC European Union Joint Research Centre communities
 - EU-JRC fund projects to foster EU research collaboration.
e.g. HUMAINT human behaviour and machine intelligence
” Our project involves a core team of researchers plus a community of experts in cognitive science, machine learning, human-computer interaction and economy. 
The project organizes a series of scientific events …”
