It quantifies how well a model predicts a set of test data. Lower perplexity indicates a model that is better at predicting the test set because it suggests the model is more certain about its word predictions."}]}

Backoff involves using a lower-order N-gram model if the higher-order model fails to find a match for a given word sequence. Interpolation, on the other hand, combines probabilities from different order N-gram models, typically weighted by coefficients, to estimate the probability of word sequences, even if some sequences have not been seen in the training data."}]}

By adding one to the count of all word sequences, including those not seen in the training data, it ensures that no sequence has a zero probability. This helps in estimating more accurate probabilities for word sequences, thereby improving the model's performance."}]}

Backoff involves falling back to a lower-order N-gram model when a higher-order sequence hasn't been seen. Interpolation, on the other hand, combines probabilities from all N-gram orders, adjusting the influence of each based on the context. Interpolation tends to perform better as it always considers the broader context by mixing different N-gram orders."}]}

Not properly handling OOV words can significantly impair a model's ability to understand and generate text accurately. Techniques like creating an unknown word token (<UNK>) and training its probabilities allow models to better generalize and handle new or rare words they encounter, improving overall performance."}]}

It involves removing N-grams that occur below a certain frequency threshold, which helps reduce the model's complexity and storage requirements. Pruning focuses on retaining only the most informative N-grams, thereby improving the efficiency and speed of language models without significantly compromising their predictive accuracy."}]}

For example, for the sentence 'I want to eat Chinese food,' the method calculates the probability by multiplying the bigram probabilities together, assuming at least one example of every bigram exists in the training set. This technique can generate plausible sentences based on the calculated probabilities of word sequences."}]}

This issue becomes more pronounced as the N-gram order increases, resulting in almost all quadrigrams having a zero probability unless they actually occur in the specific training corpus, such as Shakespeare's works. This limitation significantly impacts the model's ability to generate diverse text or accurately predict less common sequences."}]}

The model 'backs off' to a lower-order N-gram (e.g., from a trigram to a bigram) if available. If the lower-order N-gram also has a zero probability, it may back off further to a unigram. This strategy helps in estimating the probability of unseen sequences by utilizing the probabilities of shorter sequences."}]}

It involves weighting each N-gram level's probability by a coefficient (lambda) that sums up to one, thereby balancing the influence of each N-gram level based on the context. This method helps in avoiding overfitting to the training corpus and improves the model's ability to generalize across different texts."}]}

During training, any word not in the fixed vocabulary is labeled as UNK, allowing the model to train probabilities for unknown words. This approach helps the model to generalize better to new texts containing words not seen in the training corpus by assigning a non-zero probability to these OOV words."}]}
