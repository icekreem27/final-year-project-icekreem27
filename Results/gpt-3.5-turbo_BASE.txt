Rouge
With RAG: 0.5890
Without RAG: 0.1811
The model using RAG shows a significantly higher ROUGE score, indicating a much better overlap with the reference summaries or translations. This suggests that the RAG-enhanced model is more effective at capturing key points from the reference texts, likely benefiting from additional context retrieved during the generation process.

Bleu
With RAG: 0.4491
Without RAG: 0.1935
Similarly, the BLEU score improvement with RAG is notable. The higher BLEU score for the RAG model signifies a closer match to the reference translations in terms of precision and accuracy, likely due to RAG's ability to pull in relevant external information to inform its translations or text generation.

Meteor
With RAG: 0.5138
Without RAG: 0.4260
While both models have closer METEOR scores than the other metrics, the RAG model still outperforms the non-RAG model. This indicates that the inclusion of RAG improves the semantic quality of translations by considering synonyms, paraphrases, and other linguistic nuances.

BERTScore
With RAG: 0.9294
Without RAG: 0.8882
The BERTScore, which measures semantic similarity at a more nuanced level than the other metrics, is higher for the RAG model. This suggests that the RAG model is better at generating text that is semantically similar to the reference texts, benefiting from the enriched context it accesses during the generation process.

F1 Score
With RAG: 0.5965
Without RAG: 0.2490
The F1 Score sees a substantial improvement with the use of RAG, indicating a significant boost in the model's accuracy, balancing precision and recall effectively. This suggests the RAG model is better at identifying relevant information and generating responses that are closely aligned with reference outputs.

Semantic Similarity Score
With RAG: 0.8361
Without RAG: 0.7897
Even though both models perform relatively well in terms of semantic similarity, the RAG model still has a higher score. This means it's better at producing text that captures the meaning of the reference texts, benefiting from its ability to incorporate external knowledge or data into the generation process.

Overall Analysis:
The comparison clearly shows the benefits of using RAG in an NLP model. The RAG model outperforms the non-RAG model across all metrics, indicating its superiority in understanding and generating text that is closely aligned with human-generated reference texts. This improvement is most likely due to RAG's ability to augment the generation process with relevant information retrieved from a large corpus, enhancing the model's output in terms of relevance, semantic quality, and alignment with reference standards.
